This is a significantly improved version of my Assignment one “What Home Means To Me” project (Due to technical issues of my assignment 2 group project) This version has updated lighting and texture smoothness to the over all terrain of the game. There are various colored lights signifying different aspects of the map where intractable objects exist. The billboard that you see at the star of the game is indicating what you you searching for throughout the map. While exploring game, you will also find two small laminated cubes that are trigger sound upon interaction. These emit a sound to set the tone of the game considering this is a low level fantasy game.
